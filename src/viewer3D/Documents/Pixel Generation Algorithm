PIXEL ALGORITHM
    Create a grid of pixel points on the screen space
    Find the set of polygons that are intersected by a line going through the observer and a pixel point on the projection plane
    Tell each polygon to give the color present at the intersection point
    Store the distance of the intersection point from the observer, as well as the color
    Find the polygon point that is the minimum distance from the observer, and set the pixel array to that color
