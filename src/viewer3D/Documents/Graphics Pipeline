FULL GRAPHICS PIPELINE
    √ Generate Polygons
    √ Project Polygons to a projection plane
    √ Generate pixel points on projection plane in a 2D array of vectors, one for every pixel
    √ Map projection plane (and its polygons) to screen space
    Create Raster corresponding to screen pixels
    Access each screen space polygon
        Find any point on screen space polygon
        Recursively walk through points on projected polygon
            √ check if point exists in triangle
            use point coordinates relative to screenspace to get corresponding index of 2D projection plane vector array
            Get intersection of world space polygon through observer and point at found index in vector array
            Retrieve and store, color and observer distance, in the raster
            walk to the next point in screen space
    return the raster to the controller
    pass the raster to the drawer

CURRENT GRAPHICS PIPELINE

World space
Get set of polygons, give to camera
Camera maps all polygons to projection plane
projection plane is rotated to align perpendicular to z-axis
rotate projection plane is adjusted to screen space (translation)
camera passes polygons to controller which passes them to the drawer
the drawer converts the polygons to 2D polygons, which are then filled
